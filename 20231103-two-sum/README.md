# Two Sum II Data Structure design

## Challenge name: 

Two-Sum-II-Data-Structure-design

## Description: 

Designed and implemented a TwoSum class. This class should support the following operations: add and find. add: Adds the number to an internal data structure. find: Finds if there exists a pair of numbers whose sum is equal to the given value. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based. 

## Example

**add function**

```
Input: The numbers that will be entered into the data structure.
```

---

**find function**
    
Starting from the array created in the previous function, which is as follows: [2,7,11,15]
```
Input: target = 9
Output: index1=1, index2=2
```

## Test

Run the following command:
```
node two-sum.js
```
